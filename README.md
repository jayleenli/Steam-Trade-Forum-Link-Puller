# Steam-Trade-Forum-Link-Puller
Place your HTML page of your badge pages (can input more than one page) and it will get your steam ID from the HTML, 
and all the steam IDs for the badges you have on your steam badge page (including steam badges and full sets). 
Then will check each one of the steam ID's trading forums for a post on the first page and check the blacklisted steam ID's(optional). 
The remaining steam ID games will be kept and it will pull up the trading forum pages from steam for each one of the steam IDs using 
your default browser. 

PLEASE NOTE!!
Takes about 55 seconds each steam badge page to run. (BECAUSE OF WEBCLIENT)

Developer note
-This is the first C# project I've created, it's not much, but its gets the job done. I originally wanted to make a bot that would autopost,
But Steam's security is too high, and I didn't want to deal with that, so this was the way around it. 
-Also the autoposting will have to be done with Jquery in a chrome extension(briefly mentioned in the youtube video I have linked here)

Thank you for reading this, and looking at my c# project XD
